            <small>Still waiting for my FVC sticker, but I rep our brands on the Forester.</small>
            <p>HPAG has also enabled me to use some of my other creative skills in photography, graphic design, videoography, 3D modeling, and more. These are all used extensively across the different brand sites to enhance the customer experience, customer understanding, and brand reputation.</p>
